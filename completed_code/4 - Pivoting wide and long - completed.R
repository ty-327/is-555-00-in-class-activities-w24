# Function Summary --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# JUST TWO FUNCTIONS:
# 
# I'm going to narrate the two functions with their parameters as a new way to help...?
# 
# Pay special attention to the parameters with the ** as they are the most important.
# 
# pivot_longer(
#   data,                             <-- The incoming tibble, usually comes in via a pipe
#   **cols,                           <-- This is where you say which columns you're pulling down to long format
#                                           (any that you don't name here are assumed to be "id columns" that 
#                                           will repeat with each of the variables being converted to long format)
#   **names_to = "name",              <-- This is the column name that will "house" the column names that you have 
#                                           specified in the `cols` parameter. Often you can just leave this as the 
#                                           default and it will name it "name", but you can also be more descriptive
#   names_prefix = NULL,              <-- You can (optionally) indicate a text-based prefix to auto-remove as the
#                                           function is pulling the columns down. So for columns like `year1`, `year2`,
#                                           you could specify "year" as the prefix and the function would remove it.
#   names_sep = NULL,                 <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want. 
#   names_pattern = NULL,             <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   names_ptypes = NULL,              <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   names_transform = NULL,           <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   names_repair = "check_unique",    <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   **values_to = "value",              <-- this is the column that will "house" the values corresponding to each of 
#                                           the column name labels in the `names_to` column that you specified above.
#   values_drop_na = FALSE,           <-- wider data is often "sparse", meaning that it has lots of nulls when not all
#                                           rows have a value for each wide column. It's usually efficient to filter 
#                                           those out when pivoting longer, so this is an option for convenience.
#   values_ptypes = NULL,             <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   values_transform = NULL,          <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.

# pivot_wider(                        
#   data,                             <-- The incoming tibble, usually comes in via a pipe
#   id_cols = NULL,                   <-- "id columns" are the ones that you DON'T want to spread out as wide
#                                           columns, but you can usually ignore this parameter because you will
#                                           be explicitly specifying the `names_from` and `values_from` parameters
#   id_expand = FALSE,                <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   **names_from = name,                <-- Here you specify the column that contains the value names or "labels"
#                                           (it defaults to `name` because that's the default from `pivot_longer()`)
#   names_prefix = "",                <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   names_sep = "_",                  <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   names_glue = NULL,                <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   names_sort = FALSE,               <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.

#   names_repair = "check_unique",    <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   **values_from = value,              <-- Here you specify the column that contains the values corresponding to the
#                                           names specified in the `names_from` parameter.
#                                           (it defaults to `value` because that's the default from `pivot_longer()`)
#   values_fill = NULL,               <-- This option allows you to provide the "default value" for any rows in the
#                                           wider data that don't have a value in the longer format list. (Leaving
#                                           this out will result in NAs in the wider data, which is usually fine.)
#   values_fn = NULL,                 <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
#   unused_fn = NULL,                 <-- beyond our scope - explore this on your own if you want.
