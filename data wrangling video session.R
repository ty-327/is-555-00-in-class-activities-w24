# This is a mostly useless question, but we used it to illustrate what happens when naming conflicts occur

# 
# What is the average "birth year" of planes associated with delayed departures among flights to Atlanta?

# Joining the data to get the "birth year" in creates unexpected results with the two year columns. 
# Notice the mostly empty columns from the `df_planes` tibble... this is because the join is attempting
# to join on both tailnum and year, and the years mean different things
df_flights %>%

  # filter(!is.na(engine)) %>%

# Here's one strategy: just rename the right-side year on the fly to something useful. Name conflict solved.
df_flights %>% 
  left_join(df_planes %>% select(tailnum, year) %>% rename(mfctr_year = year), by = join_by(tailnum)) %>%

# Or you could do it as a separate operation... with more lines of code :(

df_flights %>%

# Finally, the suffix parameter lets you pass an automatic "label" for each side that gets appended in any 
# case where there is a naming conflict.

# Binding data - stacking chunks with bind_rows()

# I'm just manually splitting this data into two tibbles with the same columns and two chunks of the full data:

flights_half1 <- flights %>% 
  slice(1:199388)

flights_half2 <- flights %>% 
  slice(199389:336776)

flights_half1
flights_half2



# I usually like to use bind rows outside a pipe because it can take any number of tibble as parameters, and
# that can get confusing in a piped scenario. (I'm obviously piping it after the bind_rows so we can see what
# it looks like after.)
